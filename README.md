# Bikesharing

## Overview
In this project we used Tableau to analyaze and visualize NYC CitiBike data from August 2019 in an effort to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, we have provided an in depth bike trip analysis.

- There were over 2.3 million rides for the month of August 2019.
- 81% of the users were subscribers. 65% of the users were confirmed males and 25% were confirmed females.
- Top ride starting locations are in the most touristic and busy areas, as we see here in Manhattan.

- The majority of weekday rides are during typical work commuting hours (7:00-9:00am & 5:00-7:00pm)
- The majority of weekend rides are during lunch time (11:00am-3:00pm)
- Men are utilizing the CitiBike service more frequently

## Summary
The data shows that the CitiBike service had substantial activity in NYC during the month of August 2019. 
The bike rides primarily took place within lower Manhattan with Male users making up the vast majority of those rides. Peak bike utilization was during morning and evening rush hours thus implying that the CitiBike service is used as an alternative mode of public transportation.
Additional analysis before launching venture in Des Moines would be to:
- Compare data for different months to determine trends across the year,
- Include weather data to find the correlation between the weather and the rides.
- Compare avg distance per ride between high density cities (NYC) vs low density (Des Moines).
